# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Building a Rock-Paper-Scissors website!

Most documentation can be see in the code itself. But since I am blogging all my production and learning, I will do so here.

### Creating the project

1) First we must Understand, Plan, and Divide (and conquer).
    - To do so, we must understand the problem/project.
    - We are creating a very simple game
    - Different way to win

2) Planning out the game
    - There are instructions in the TOP project website, so we'll go from there. [Rock-paper-scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
    - More planning will be inside the JS code

3) Divide
    - Broke the problem into smaller parts. Steps were created in the JS file.

Dev tools in Google Chrome was a life saver!!!! Was able to find out why the player selection was never changing. Did an event listener breakpoint for going through each javascript line of code. Saw some of the updates that weren't being made and some that were. Dev tools definitely helped debug this little game I created. Will add more updates as soon we get back to this.
